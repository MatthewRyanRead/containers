- Update `ReadableArrayList` to cache and invalidate its hashcode
- MORE TESTS
    - Index tests for lists (especially `removeAt()`)
- Update iterators to deal with concurrent modifications (?)
- Make concurrency-safe implementations
- Helper method for `WritableHashSet` to alter size and the cached hashcode at the same time?
- Create a `Node` class in `ReadableHashSet` and use a linked list of `Node<E>` for each entry in the array
- Add more JavaDoc to methods
